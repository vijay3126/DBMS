The following database is refined upto second normal form. Upgrade this schema without any transitive dependency. 
Book (BookID, BookTitle, AuthorID, PublisherID, PublishDate, AuthorCountry).
Author (AuthorID, AuthorName, AuthorCountry)
Publisher (PublisherID, PublisherName, PublisherLocation).
Transaction (TransactionID, BookID, BorrowerID, BorrowDate, ReturnDate).
The below order table contains information about customers, restaurants, and dishes ordered, all in one table only. This leads to potential redundancy and dependency issues.  Please refine this schema every non key attribute depends on key attribute
Ordertable (OrderID (Primary Key), CustomerName, CustomerPhone, RestaurantName, DishName;DishPrice,Quantity;OrderDate,DeliveryDate).
The following database schema is a Library Management System (LMS) that stores information about books, authors, and their borrowings: this schema not following any normalization process. Refine this schema upto 2nd normal form.
Schema:
Book ( BookID (Primary Key),BookTitle, AuthorName, AuthorCountry, BorrowerID, BorrowerName, BorrowDate)

i) Find the names of sailors who have reserved a Red boat. 
ii) Find the names of sailors who have reserved at least one boat. 
iii) Find the names of sailors who have reserved a Red and a Green boat. iv) Find the names of sailors who have reserved a Red or a White boat. 
v) Find the names of sailors who have reserved all boats.

Create a trigger that calculates the total marks, percentage, grade, and result of a student after inserting data into the Student table. The trigger should be fired AFTER INSERT and should populate the Result table.
 Tables:
 Student(rollno, sname, marks1, marks2, marks3)
 Result(rollno, total_marks, average, grade, result)


A bank operates a transaction system where multiple customers perform operations like deposits, withdrawals, and balance checks concurrently. To ensure data consistency and prevent anomalies, the system uses a Timestamp-Based Concurrency Control Protocol. Analyze the given scenario, identify concurrency issues, and propose solutions based on timestamp ordering.
Lock-based protocols are critical in Database Management Systems (DBMS) to handle concurrency issues when multiple transactions execute simultaneously. In what ways do lock-based concurrency control protocols contribute to enforcing the ACID properties and preserving database consistency and integrity?
A hotel booking system handles reservations, cancellations, and room availability enquiries. Guests and hotel staff perform multiple concurrent transactions daily. System crashes or failures occasionally disrupt operations. Recover the data using log based protocols without affecting the data integrity. 
An e-commerce platform handles customer orders, inventory updates, and payment processing. A single transaction involves several interconnected steps that must be executed atomically, evaluate the database without any data inconsistency.
Explain the ACID Properties of transaction.
